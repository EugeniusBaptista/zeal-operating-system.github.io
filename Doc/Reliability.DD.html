<a name="l3"></a>ZealOS is like the 1040EZ tax form compared to the full 1040 form.  Obviously, it is simpler.  If you allow mission creep, 
<a name="l4"></a>pretty soon the 1040EZ looks just like the 1040 and the messed-up 1040EZ has no purpose.
<a name="l5"></a>
<a name="l6"></a>The Commodore 64 had a file system that was simple enough for peers in Terry's generation to enjoy the thrill of knowing 
<a name="l7"></a>exactly what is going on at the hardware level and writing fun projects to access it.
<a name="l8"></a>
<a name="l9"></a>The primary design criteria is simplicity.  If it is simple enough for only 100,000 people to learn, lets try to make it 
<a name="l10"></a>simpler so that 1 million can learn it.
<a name="l11"></a>
<a name="l12"></a>Obviously, we don't do bad block tables, or redundant FATs.
<a name="l13"></a>
<a name="l14"></a>We use the simplest possible technique, a contiguous-file-only allocation bitmap, not </span><a href="https://zeal-operating-system.github.io/Doc/BlkChain.DD.html#l1"><span class=cF4>Block Chains</span></a><span class=cF0> or FAT tables.
<a name="l15"></a>
<a name="l16"></a>You can be a good toy or you can be a good professional tool, but not both.  ZealOS's file manager will start too slowly once 
<a name="l17"></a>a few thousand files exist because the file manager makes a list of all files on start-up.
<a name="l18"></a>
<a name="l19"></a>Do not have more than a few thousand files or the file manager will not function.
<a name="l20"></a>
<a name="l21"></a>You are encouraged to keep your entire drive limited to, maybe, 100 Meg of files because you are suppoosed to operate as a 
<a name="l22"></a>kayak instead of a Titanic. If you do this, backing-up will be only a minute or so and you should do it at least once a day.
<a name="l23"></a>
<a name="l24"></a>Third party software should be run from ISO files or CD/DVDs directly, without installing to hard drive.
<a name="l25"></a>
<a name="l26"></a>Multimedia graphics and sound is, basically, forbidden.  If you ignore this, all hell will break loose because memory will 
<a name="l27"></a>fragment with large files and the original vision of kayak hard-drive back-ups won't work.
